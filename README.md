# PythonRankCalculator

This program is used with video games (or any game) to calculate a rank based on win percentage.  I created this to be able to track my win percentage throughout a night of playing video games.  There is also an option to add additional players/friends and continuously enter their wins/losses.  After each time the wins/losses are updated, the updated win percentage is appended to a list which shows the win percentage over time.  A plot can be viewed of the progression of win percentage, which is translated to a rank.  Additionally, a plot of all players and their respective win progression over time can be viewed.
